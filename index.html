<p>Types of Tax Treatment of Fringe Benefits The IRC may provide that a fringe benefit is taxable, nontaxable, partially taxable or taxdeferred.<br> These terms are defined below. Taxable – Includible in gross income, not excluded under any IRC section. <br> If the recipient is an employee, this amount is includible as wages and reported by the employer on Form W-2 and generally is subject to federal income tax withholding, Social Security and Medicare taxes.<br> For example, bonuses are always taxable because they are income under Section 61 and no IRC section excludes them from taxation. Fringe benefits that do not meet any statutory requirements for exclusion are fully taxable. Although there are special rules and elections for certain benefits, in general, employers report taxable fringe benefits as wages on Form W-2 for the year in which the employee received them. No tax reporting is required for benefits that meet the accountable plan rules. IRC Section 451(a); Announcement (Ann.) 85-113, 1985-31 I.R.B. 31 If an employee’s wages are not normally subject to Social Security or Medicare taxes (for example, because the employee is covered by a qualifying public retirement system), these taxes would not apply to fringe benefits the employee received. However, the value of the benefits must still be reported for income tax withholding purposes. Nontaxable (excludable) – Excluded from wages by a specific IRC section; for example, qualified health plan benefits are excludable under IRC Section 105.</p>
